            We take part in events run by amazing people with a passion for
            fundraising, and have organised events combining charitable aims
            with the enjoyment of beer made by some of the most talented
            breweries in the UK and beyond.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Our events have raised funds for charities such as Art Against
            Knives, Hackney Winter Night Shelter, Mind, The Newman Holiday Trust
            and more!
